## The Problem

Netflix Standard costs **$15.49/month**. Disney+ is **$7.99/month**. Amazon Prime Video is **$8.99/month**. That's **$32.47 every single month** — or **$389/year** — just to watch movies and shows that are often removed without warning.

In countries like Brazil, India, or Mexico, a single Netflix subscription can represent **1–4% of the monthly minimum wage**. That's not entertainment, that's a luxury tax.

## The Solution: Stremio

[Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) is a beautiful, free and open-source media center that works on **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and smart TVs**. Think of it like a Netflix-style interface that you control.

By itself Stremio is just a shell — the magic comes from addons.

## The Torrentio Addon

[Torrentio](https://torrentio.strem.fun/) is the most powerful Stremio addon available. It aggregates torrent sources in real-time and streams them directly inside Stremio — no downloading, no waiting, just click and watch.

**What you get:**

- Virtually any movie or TV show ever made, in HD or 4K
- Subtitles in dozens of languages (powered by OpenSubtitles)
- Multiple quality options (720p, 1080p, 4K)
- Works on desktop, mobile, Android TV, and Fire TV Stick
