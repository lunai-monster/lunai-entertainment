## The problem with music subscriptions

Spotify costs $11.99/mo. Apple Music $10.99/mo. YouTube Music $13.99/mo. You're paying every month just to listen to music you don't own, on apps riddled with algorithmic nudges and ads the moment your subscription lapses.

## Echo — an extension-based music player

[Echo](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo) is a free, open-source Android music player built around a plugin/extension system. Instead of being locked to one provider, Echo lets you install community extensions that pull music from sources of your choice — giving you a single, clean interface for all of it.

**Key features:**

- Clean, modern Material You UI
- Extension-based: add the sources you want, remove what you don't
- Offline support for local music files
- No account required, no tracking, no ads
- Actively developed with a growing community

## How to get started

1. Download the latest Echo APK from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/brahmkshatriya/echo/releases) or join the Discord community for extension links.
2. Open Echo and head to **Extensions** in settings.
3. Install extensions for the music sources you want.
4. That's it — browse, search, and play.

## What you save

| Service | Monthly | Yearly |
|---|---|---|
| Spotify Premium | $11.99 | $143.88 |
| Apple Music | $10.99 | $131.88 |
| YouTube Music | $13.99 | $167.88 |
| **Echo** | **$0** | **$0** |

Even replacing just Spotify saves you **$143.88 / year**.

## A note on the project

Echo is currently being rebuilt as a multiplatform app (Android + Desktop) using Jetpack Compose. The new version is under active development. Check the [Discord](https://discord.gg/J3WvbBUU8Z) for the latest builds.
