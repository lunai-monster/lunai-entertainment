## The Problem

YouTube Premium costs **$13.99/month** just to remove ads and enable background play. On top of that, Twitch subs and Turbo can run another **$18.97/month**. That's **$32.96/month** — over **$395/year** — spread across two platforms, two apps, two accounts.

## Just Use Grayjay

[Grayjay](https://grayjay.app/) is a free, open-source Android app by FUTO. It's a single app that pulls in content from every major platform — YouTube, Twitch, Nebula, Rumble, Odysee, SoundCloud, PeerTube, and more — with no ads, no tracking, and no subscriptions required.

**What you get:**

- Watch and subscribe to YouTube channels — ad-free
- Watch Twitch streams live — no Turbo needed
- Background play so you can listen with the screen off
- Offline downloads
- One unified feed for all your subscriptions across every platform
- No account required to watch anything
- Your data never leaves your device

Grayjay is free. The developers optionally ask for a **one-time $8 payment** if you want to support them — no subscription, ever.
