## The Problem

"Free" Gmail and Google Drive are not actually free — you pay with your emails being scanned for ad targeting, your files stored on Google's servers, and your productivity data used to train machine learning models. Microsoft 365 charges **$6.99/month** on top of that.

Google One (for extra storage) adds another **$1.99/month**. That's **$8.98/month** for the privilege of having your data harvested.

## Proton Suite

[Proton](https://proton.me/) is a Swiss-based company that builds **end-to-end encrypted** apps. Everything is encrypted on your device before it reaches their servers — they literally cannot read your data even if they wanted to.

**What the free tier includes:**

- **Proton Mail** — Encrypted email, 1 GB storage, custom filters
- **Proton Drive** — 5 GB encrypted cloud storage
- **Proton Calendar** — Encrypted calendar
- **Proton VPN** — Free VPN with no speed limits and no logs
- **Proton Pass** — Password manager with unlimited logins

No credit card required. The free tier is genuinely useful.

**Paid plans** start at $3.99/month if you want more storage (500 GB) or a custom domain — still cheaper than Google One + Microsoft 365 combined.

## What You Save

| What people pay | Monthly | Yearly |
|---|---|---|
| Google One 100 GB | $1.99 | $23.88 |
| Microsoft 365 Personal | $6.99 | $83.88 |
| **Total** | **$8.98** | **$107.76** |

With Proton free tier + Nextcloud: **$0** (or ~$3/month for Proton+ with 500 GB).

**Annual savings: up to $107.76**
